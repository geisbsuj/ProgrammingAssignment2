## The puspose of makeCacheMatrix is to store a martix and a cached value of the inverse of the matrix

## While cacheSolve should computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

## Write a short comment describing this function

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
